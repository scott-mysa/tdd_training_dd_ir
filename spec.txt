Lemonade Stand
--------------

* The lemonde stand game is a kids game to teach basic math and business.
* The object of the game is to sell as much lemonade in 7 days and become the leader in the leaderboard
* The first iteration of the game is quite simple, but it can certainly be extended as we get more into it.
* Our task is to create the game engine, the UI can be added later

Game Rules:
* You will start the game with $10. 
* Each day you will be presented with a weather forecast for the day which will either be
	* Overcast
	* Clear
	* Sunny

* At the start of the day you need to decide how many jugs of lemonade to make and how much to sell each cup of lemondade for. 
	* A jug of lemonade contains 14 cups
	* A jug costs $3.50 dollars to make

* You can only make full jugs (i.e. 1.5 jugs is invalid)

* The weather forecast and price of a cup will determine how many cups you will sell

* The price of a cup can be between 0 and $2 in $0.05 increments
* Any profits earned in a day can be used to buy more lemonade the next day
* Any lemonade not sold will be wasted and will cost 15c per cup to dispose of
* The game automatically ends if your funds reach zero or below

* The calculation for number of customers is:
	* (Base # customers * Weather Multiplier) - (Base # customers * Weather Multiplier) * price multiplier
		* The base # of customers is a seed value that all other calculations are driven from
	* Overcast: multiplied by a number between 1.3 and 1.6
	* Clear: multiplied by a number between 1.7 and 2.1
	* Sunnny: multiplied by a number between 2.2 and
	* Price multipler: 
		$0.25 is the break-even point (multiplier 0)
		Any price over $0.25 the multiplier goes up by -0.025
			Examples: 
				* a $0.30 cup will have a multiplier of -0.025
				* a $0.35 cup will have a multiplier of -0.050
				* a $2 cup will have a multiplier of -0.875



	Example:
	Base #: 25
	Weather: Overcast (1.7)
	Price per cup: 0.50c (-0.125)
	Max # of customers = ((25 * 1.7) - (25 * 1.7) * -0.125
	* 38 customers *
